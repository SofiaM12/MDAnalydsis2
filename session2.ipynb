MDAnalysis is also able to read a wide variety of different simulation coordinate formats. A full list of these can be seen in the [coordinates documentation](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#supported-coordinate-formats). These coordinate or trajectory formats hold the dynamic, temporal information from simulations such as coordinates, dimensions, velocities, and forces.\n\nHere we demonstrate how one can use MDAnalysis to read, explore, and write trajectory data.\n\nAs ever, please feel free to reach out to any of the below resources for more help:\n\n* [User guide](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/2.0.0-dev0/)\n* [API documentation](docs.mdanalysis.org/2.0.0-dev0/)\n* [Discussion / user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion)\n* [Developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/mdnalysis-devel)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/fXTSfDJyxE)\n\nSee a bug?
